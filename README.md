# LeechSTRO

Visual Basic 6 FTP client developed in 2003 when I was 16, inspired by the classic freeware FTP client [LeechFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeechFTP).

The term `STRO` is inspired by the term [*pubstro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubstro), referring to hacked servers used for illegal FTP warez distribution in the early 2000s.
